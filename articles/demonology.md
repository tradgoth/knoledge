## The Lesser Key of Solomon

The Lesser Key of Solomon is a 17th-century grimoire containing detailed descriptions of 72 demons and the rituals to summon, bind, and command them. Silent Hill draws extensively from this text, weaving demonology into its religious horror framework.

The grimoire is directly referenced in SH3, and references to the Order following it are present throughout the series.

## The Solomonic Legend

According to Jewish and Islamic tradition, King Solomon possessed a magical ring given to him by the Archangel Michael. With this ring, he:

- Commanded demons to build the First Temple
- Bound 72 demons in a brass vessel
- Cast them into a lake in Babylon where they were forced to serve humanity

The Order's practices mirror these Solomonic rituals by attempting to bind, control, and utilize supernatural entities for their own purposes.

## The Flauros and the Seal of Metatron

The pyramid shape of the Flauros artifact incorporates the same sacred geometry found in the Seal of Metatron. In Kabbalistic tradition, the protective properties of the Seal derive partly from this sacred geometry.

Flauros represents **truth versus deception, binding versus freedom**—central themes as Harry navigates Dahlia's lies.

When Dahlia describes the Flauros as a "cage of peace," she's referencing its connection to Metatronic symbolism—the same protective framework Alessa used when inscribing the Seal around Silent Hill.

The five pieces of the Flauros (**Past, Present, Future, Truth, Falsehood**) mirror the multi-dimensional nature of Metatron's domain as the angel who bridges human understanding and divine knowledge.

## Paimon — King of Hell (SH2 Remake)

In the Silent Hill 2 Remake, three gemstone cubes combine to form the **Sigil of Paimon**—a King of Hell from the Ars Goetia, the first section of the Lesser Key.

**Paimon's Attributes:**

- Lucifer's most loyal ally among the 72 demons
- Associated with knowledge, arts, war, and vanity
- Reveals "eternal secrets" of heaven
- Grants clairvoyance (past, present, future)
- Sometimes associated with Azazel

These powers connect directly to Silent Hill 2's themes: the "In Water" ending, the "Rebirth" ending's resurrection ritual, and James's journey to uncover suppressed truths.

## Azazel — The Book of Enoch

In the Book of Enoch, Azazel is a leader among the **Watchers**—the 200 angels who abandoned heaven to descend to Earth. He is portrayed as the chief architect of human corruption through forbidden technologies and secrets.

> "He is to cast lots for the two goats—one lot for the Lord and the other for the scapegoat [Azazel]." — Leviticus 16:8

God commanded the archangels to "ascribe all sin" to Azazel, effectively making him the **ultimate source of human evil**—the original scapegoat.

Some interpretations in First Enoch identify Azazel as a Nephilim and son of Lilith, further connecting to Silent Hill's dark feminine mythology.

## The Seal of Metatron

The Seal of Metatron is primarily associated with Jewish mysticism (Kabbalah) and early mystical traditions. Metatron is a prominent archangel in Jewish literature, described as the **highest angel, a celestial scribe**, arising from mystical texts within Rabbinic literature and the Talmud.

In sacred geometry, Metatron's Cube is derived from the "Fruit of Life" and represents the underlying structure of all creation, often linked to the flow of creative energy.

While the cult considers it merely a talisman, it holds power to inhibit the cult's influence. Alessa inscribed it around town as a **"spell of annihilation"**—attempting self-destruction and preventing God's birth.

**Dahlia deceptively renamed it the "Mark of Samael" to manipulate Harry into undoing Alessa's protections.**

## The Marks of Samael and Lilith

The marks represent a powerful, dualistic force in occult, Jewish mysticism, and modern left-hand path traditions. They embody the union of the **"slant serpent" (Samael)** and the **"torturous serpent" (Lilith)**.

This represents a balance of destruction from above and below, acting as a dark, inverted mirror to the divine union of Adam and Eve.

The Hebrew letters for Samael and Lilith are often inscribed on the arms of the inverted goat-headed pentagram used as the Sigil for Baphomet.

## Dahlia's Deception

In Silent Hill, the "Mark of Samael" is a **false name** given by Dahlia Gillespie to deceive Harry Mason. The actual symbol is the Seal of Metatron (or Talisman of Metatron).

Dahlia tells Harry the Metatron is actually the Mark of Samael, while simultaneously using the Flauros—an artifact whose protective power derives from the same Metatronic geometry—to further her goals.

This means in Silent Hill, the Lesser Key's Flauros links to Kabbalistic geometry rather than treating them as separate occult references.

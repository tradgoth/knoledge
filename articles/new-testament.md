## 1 Corinthians 6:2-3 (Film)

The 2006 Silent Hill film features a billboard with explicit scripture—the most direct New Testament quotation in any Silent Hill media.

> "Do you not know that the saints will judge the world? And if the world will be judged by you, are you unworthy to judge the smallest matters? Do you not know that we shall judge angels?"

The Apostle Paul rebukes members of the early church in Corinth for taking disputes to secular courts rather than resolving them within the Christian community. He argues that if believers are destined for such high cosmic authority in the future, they should certainly be capable of handling minor earthly disagreements.

**Alessa is judged by the Order in a similar manner—condemned by those who claim divine authority yet act as hypocrites.**

## Matthew 7:21-23 / 23:27 — The Pharisee Parallel

> "Not everyone who says to me, 'Lord, Lord,' will enter the kingdom of heaven, but the one who does the will of my Father who is in heaven. On that day many will say to me, 'Lord, Lord, did we not prophesy in your name, and cast out demons in your name, and do many mighty works in your name?' And then will I declare to them, 'I never knew you; depart from me, you workers of lawlessness.'"

The film's cult draws parallels to the Pharisees who opposed Jesus. This particular verse—Jesus's own words against His opponents—fits these wretches perfectly:

> "Woe to you, teachers of the law and Pharisees, you hypocrites! You are like whitewashed tombs, which look beautiful on the outside but on the inside are full of the bones of the dead."

## Thematic New Testament Parallels

### Messianic Sacrifice

Heather/Alessa functions as an inverted Christ figure—a savior whose suffering enables cosmic transformation, though through **resistance** rather than submission.

### Pharisee Critique

Christabella and the rest of her order are a cinematic analogy for the Pharisees, the religious scholars who opposed Jesus and eventually pushed for His execution.
